person you tried to invite was already invited to join Shop and Buzz, but they declined.
He or she will need to register for Shop and Buzz without the benefit of a generated
invitation.<br><br> While Shop and Buzz has let the person know that we won't be sending
him or her anymore email, there's nothing stopping you from sending an email outside
our system. :)
