<p class="whitetext">Do you wish you had an easy way to get happy buyers to come back <i>and</i> to tell friends about you? Do you wish this would run itself with no effort? <b>Start driving buyer loyalty with Shop And Buzz!</b><br><br>
There are 5 easy steps to have S&amp;B inspire your happy buyers.<br>
<ol class="whitetext">
<li>Join S&amp;B. Set up the flat or percentage commissions you want to pay to buzzing buyers. You can set up separate payouts for the happy buyers who spread the word (the "buzzing buyer") and the new buyers they bring you. For example, you might want to give the buzzing buyer who spread the word 3% of what the people they recommend spend with you. You might want to give the new buyer $5 off their first purchase to get them buying right after they receive that recommendation.<ul><li>Note that commissions are NOT a pyramid. If the new buyer starts recommending you, the original buzzing buyer does not get a piece of the next level of recommended sales.<li>You will also categorize yourself so that anybody coming to our site looking for someone who sells what you tend to sell will find <b>you</b>.</ul><br><br>
<li>Put our widgets into your listings, eBay Store, emails to buyers, and anywhere you want to promote your eBay business. All widgets are custom-coded for your S&amp;B account, and are available from the "dashboard" you'll see once you log in with your S&amp;B username and password.<br><br>
<li>Inspired buyers will follow the links in your widgets. They can log into their S&amp;B account, or join for free. They can then add you to their "Honeycomb" of sellers, and start building a "Hive" of friends.<br><br>
<li>Our system uses the eBay API, which requires an authorization "token," to watch when your buzzing buyer buys from you again, when they recommend you to friends, and when those friends buy from you. The API tells us what everybody spent so that we can accurately calculate commissions. The buzz will ripple out when new buyers add you to their Honeycomb, and start recommending you to their Hive of friends!<br><br>
<li>You will make a single monthly payment to us for your flat subscription fee plus buyer payouts. We pay all commissions, and take care of 1099s to buyers who earn total S&amp;B payouts at or past the legal threshhold for reporting the money they receive. All commissions are held 45 days to make sure that the sale goes through rather than ending in an Unpaid Item situation.
</ol>

<h2 class="whitetext">Shop And Buzz is priced as follows:</h2>
<p class="whitetext"><b>Your first month is free! Try S&amp;B... set it up... ask us questions... give it a spin!</b> Then, the paid period would kick in. :)<br><br>
<span style="font-size: 20pt">$27.00</span> per month flat goes to Shop And Buzz. This will be paid automatically by PayPal through a PayPal subscription. Each month, you will also be billed for commissions that your happy buyers have accrued. You can log into your account, see what you owe, and initate a PayPal payment so that your account is always in good standing.<br><br>
</p>
<h3 class="whitetext">No 1099s!</h3>
<p class="whitetext">For happy shoppers who reach the annual commission threshhold at which they have to be 1099'ed in the following year, <b>we will handle that</b>. The commissions are paid by us, so we will 1099 your happy shopper. You only pay us, and you can write all of your S&amp;B payments off however your accountant suggests for your particular business. </p>
<h3 class="whitetext">No Contracts!</h3>
<p class="whitetext">You are not locked into a contract with S&amp;B. It's month-to-month, and you can cancel any time. There are no refunds, so if we are holding commissions for your happy shoppers, we're going to continue holding on to them so that we can properly settle up with those people!
