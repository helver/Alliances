<p class="whitetext">You love shopping on eBay! You have great experiences with great sellers! 
Why not earn money shopping with them again and telling your friends about your fantastic 
experiences? Here's how it works.<br>
<ol class="whitetext">
<li>Join S&amp;B. It's always free - you are NEVER charged. Authorize the eBay "token." 
<li>Add sellers to your "Honeycomb." Find them on our site, find them on eBay, find them from other friends! But note that eBay's system will tell us when you buy from  will only let you add a seller from whom you've bought. We want to make sure that recommendations are real and based on experience.
<li>Add friends to your "Hive." Hives go one-way. You will always get the latest recommendations from friends you have added to your Hive, but your friends will not see your recommendations unless they have added you to their Hives.
<li>Give these great sellers your own ratings, and tell your friends why they should buy from this seller too. Every time you add a seller to your Honeycomb, your friends' Hives that include you as a member will be notified automatically of who you are recommending. That means a recommendation and opportunities to earn money take no more effort than adding the seller, rating him/her, and writing a quick blurb on why people should buy from him/her.
<li>Watch the commissions pile up! Each month, we will PayPal you with the amount that you have earned. Note that all commissions are held 45 days so that we can make sure that items really were bought and paid for... rather than ending in an Unpaid Item. Sorry, but nobody should get commissions on a sale that never really happened!
</ol>
</p>

<H2 class="whitetext">Help Grow the S&amp;B System</H2>
<p class="whitetext">Our system includes an "invitation" system, which is located in the dashboard of your account (once you log in). Tell your favorite seller to join S&amp;B so that you can earn commissions and spread the word!<br><br>
Get your friends to join too so that you can have more people checking out your recommendations. The dashboard also has specially-coded widgets you can put in emails, websites, and your blog to get people to your S&amp;B page. From there, they can add you to their Hive.</p>

<H2 class="whitetext">We Keep Your Information Private</H2>
<p class="whitetext">The law in the USA is that anybody who gets paid commissions of $600 or more in a calendar year must receive a 1099 to report that income. Our system will only collect your Social Security Number or EIN once you are close to that threshhold. You will only receive one 1099 next year from As Was, the company behind Shop And Buzz. If you were to be 1099'ed separately from each seller that paid you commission, we'd have to give those people your private information. <b>Your SSN or EIN will never be shared with anybody other than our accountant!</b> We thought you'd prefer that!<br><br>
You will not receive a 1099 from us if your commissions for that calendar year are under $600.<br><br>
<b>Will I have to pay taxes on what I earn here?</b> We don't know because we don't know what the rest of your tax return looks like, and this web page doesn't know how much you made here! You will have to declare it as miscellaneous income on next year's tax forms.<br><br>What some of our users do is to put aside 1/3 or the same percentage you have your regular job withhold from your taxes. So if you withhold 30%, and we give you a $100 payment, you might want to put $30 in your savings account just in case you owe taxes on it later. That's still $70 you didn't have before. :) If your taxes end up working out in such a way that you don't owe the government anything, then you've put a lovely amount aside in your savings account, and you'll be glad it's there. :)
