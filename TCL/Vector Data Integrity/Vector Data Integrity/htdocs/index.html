Vector Data Integrity Suite
</div>
<p class="content">The Vector Data Integrity Suite is a series of TCL applets that operate
under a single GUI interface.  The current set of operations available
include "Connection Tracing", "Billing Reconciliation", and "UPC Contract
Tagging Validation".</p>

<p class="content">In order to use this tool you need the following pieces:</p>
<p class="content"><a href="expect-5_21r1b1-setup.exe">Expect</a> - Install this first.<br>
<a href="vector_tag.exp">vector_tag.exp</a> - Grab this.<br>
<a href="vector_connections.exp">vector_connections.exp</a> - And grab this.</p>
<hr color="#cccccc" width="300" size="2">

<p class="content">In order to run the program, you need to have access to the G: drive.
Without the G: drive, you won't have any switches available to you, so
you won't get much done.</p>

<p class="content">The set up involves adding the path to "wish80" to your %PATH%.  How
to do that is beyond the scope of this document.  Additionally, the two
files "vector_tag.exp" and "vector_connections.exp" should be in the
same directory.</p>

<p class="content">Assuming that you put the two "vector_" programs in the directory
called "C:\vector", you would run the program by going into a dos prompt
and issuing the following commands:</p>
<div class="bigmargin">
<pre>
      cd c:\vector
      wish80 vector_tag.exp
</pre>
</div>
<p class="content">This will start the program up in GUI mode - which is the most useful.
However the program can also be run in command-line mode.  The syntax
is as follows:</p>
<div class="bigmargin">
<pre>
      tclsh80 vector_tag.exp [tcb] 127.0.0.1
</pre>
</div>
<p class="content">In this case, the options [tcb] indicate that you can run the program
with between 1 and 3 of the options given.  The 127.0.0.1 would be replaced
by the IP address of the Vector switch that you wanted to check up on.
The output will come back on standard out (to the screen) but you can
redirect the output to a file like so:</p>
<div class="bigmargin">
<pre>
      tclsh80 vector_tag.exp [tcb] 127.0.0.1 > c:\output1.txt
</pre>
</div>
